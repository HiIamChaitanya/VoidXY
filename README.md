# VoidXY

**Project Status:** ⚠️ Under Development - Major changes are possible, and replication is not advised at this time.

### Key implementations 

* inductive heater

* Computer vision along with inductive magnetic probe for bed leveling and motion system calibration

* development board based control board 

* native hardware API control

BTW , VoidXY is not a single, conventional 3D printer design. Instead, it's a collection of tools, software, and a framework designed to bring automation and efficiency to existing and upcoming FDM 3d printing. It's about rethinking the workflow to streamline the process and being efficient.

**Note:** This is a temporary readme file for project introduction purposes.

**Key Focus Areas:**

* **Automation:** The project emphasizes automating tasks that typically require manual intervention. This could include things like bed leveling, flow rate calibration, and even first layer adhesion optimization.

* **Fault Detection:** VoidXY aims to incorporate sensors and algorithms to detect potential mechanical issues early on, preventing printer and parts failures .

* **Calibration:** Automated calibration and self checks are a central part of the project. This ensures consistent print quality without the need for manual adjustments.

* **Workflow Enhancement:** Beyond just the printer itself, VoidXY likely seeks to improve the overall 3D printing workflow, from design to finished part.
